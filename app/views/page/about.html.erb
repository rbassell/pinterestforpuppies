    <h2>So here's the thing...</h2>

    <p>We get a lot of pitches from people who seem to think they are hollywood producers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It's like twitter, but for lists</li>
      <li>It's like the yelp of yoga studios</li>
      <li>It's like buzz feed except for movies</li>
      <li>It's like pinterest for donuts</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>SERIOUSLY, PINTEREST FOR DONUTS</h3>

    <p>So we needed to figure out something that we could build in a few weeks, an idea that would make sense at first glance that we could fill out more or less depending upon how much progress we made.</p>

    <p>Top things that people use the internet for</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Porn</li>
      <li>Pictures of puppies</li>
      <li>??? whatever</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Since #1 didn't seem professional, this is how we settled on pinterest for puppies.</p>
